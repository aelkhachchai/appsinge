[ ] Talk w/ Colosse + pedago about a bigger intra
  comment :
    - most of apprentissage ressources are split between multiple sources
    - alot of info is passed through facebook but not every body check it nor
      use it at all
    - some info are provided by mail by class delegate but not every body read
      thoses
    - provide a centralize intra for apprentissage students
    - teach students to use it as a reference, a place where they can ask
      questions
    - pedago interface w/ links publication, agenda and so on
      - ex links : pegasus, multiple epita links like epimap to regroup
    - prof inteface w/ git or file depo. Could provide a stronger place to check
      wich student deliver at wich date etc. Groups creation.
    - BDD for users, agenda, achievements etc
    - server cri?
    - internal messagery from @epita.fr mails (import outlook?) / forum like
      place?
    - early developpement : provide a whitelist from BDD except for things like
      agenda
